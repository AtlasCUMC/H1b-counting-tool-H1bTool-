# H1b-counting-tool-H1bTool-

## Introduction

H1btools is command line computational tool, which can be used for H1b visa related analysis. I developed H1btools in python platform, which can be used for any type of data analysis from the state department of US for H1b related visas.

## Useful database

We used the following data to test H1bTools: 

https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm

## Download 

clone https://github.com/AtlasCUMC/H1b-counting-tool-H1bTool-.git

OR

wget https://github.com/AtlasCUMC/H1b-counting-tool-H1bTool-/archive/master.zip

## Usage

H1btools can use in both Linux (cluster) and MAC machine.

# H1bTools Input files

H1bTools require the csv file (comma separated) and there will be _NO COMMA_ between in any line csv file such as if:

COMPUTER, INFORMATION and SYSTEMS MANAGERS

You should be remove the comma from the above line since in current version H1bTools is comma sensitive, you can convert the comma to space, and etc. In H1bTools future version, we will try our best to _overcome this issue_. 


# Example

## H1bTools Default (Certified Visas)

    python H1bTools.v3.py -I h1b_input.csv

After running the above command, you will get the following files in the same directory, which contain top 10 occupations and states respectively:


Top 10 occupations: top_10_occupations.txt 

Top 10 States: top_10_states.txt


However, the code can be also used if you do you like top 20 or 30 or any, you can use the extra flag _-N_ in H1bTools:


    python H1bTools.v3.py  â€“I h1b_input.csv  -N 1 (for example top 1) OR 5 (for example top 5) 50 (for example top 50)_ etc


We used the default columns for CASE_STATUS, SOC_CODE and WORKSITE_STATE in the input file such as CASE_STATUS on column 2, SOC_CODE 24 and WORKSITE_STATE 50 in the input file, however if it is different than that, we can specify them in command line them by using the following command:

    python H1bTools.v3.py -I h1b_input.csv -N 1 (for example top 1) OR 5 (for example top 5) 50 (for example top 50) etc -Cstatus_index (CASE_STATUS) 2 (column 2) OR 3 (column 3) etc -SOC_CODE 24 (column 24) OR etc -WORKSITE_STATE 50 (column 50) OR ETC

## H1bTools for other cases (such as CERTIFIED-WITHDRAWN, DENIED and WITHDRAWN)

H1bTools can be also used to see summary of the CERTIFIED-WITHDRAWN, DENIED and WITHDRAWN if interested by using the following command with extra flag:

     python  H1bTools.v6.py  -I h1b_input.csv -Cstatus CERTIFIED-WITHDRAWN OR DENIED OR WITHDRAWN
 
 It will provide the summary of the CERTIFIED-WITHDRAWN OR DENIED OR WITHDRAWN if user interested.
